ActiveRecord::SubclassNotFound (The single-table inheritance mechanism failed to locate the subclass: 'multiple_choice'. This error is raised because the column 'type' is reserved for storing the class in case of inheritance. Please rename this column if you didn't intend it to be used for storing the inheritance class or overwrite Exercise.inheritance_column to use another column for that information. If you wish to disable single-table inheritance for Exercise set Exercise.inheritance_column to nil):

callback on Users::UsersController, but it is listed in the controller's

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
